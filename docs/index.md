## DxR Toolkit for Fast Authoring of Immersive Visualizations

<img src="assets/img/gallery_overview.png" width="1000">

DxR is a Unity package that makes it easy and fast to create immersive visualizations, i.e., interactive data-driven graphics in augmented and virtual reality environments. Inspired by Vega-Lite, DxR uses a concise declarative JSON syntax to rapidly generate visualizations to support immersive analytics. In addition to supporting the core grammar of graphics, DxR provides a grammar of immersive interactions. DxR builds around Microsoftâ€™s mixed reality ecosystem, mainly supporting HoloLens and IHMD (immersive head-mounted device) application development.
