## DxR Toolkit for Fast Authoring of Immersive Visualizations

<img src="assets/img/gallery_overview.png" width="1000">

DxR is a Unity package that makes it easy and fast to create immersive visualizations, i.e., interactive data-driven graphics in augmented and virtual reality environments. Inspired by Vega-Lite, DxR uses a concise declarative JSON syntax to rapidly generate visualizations to support immersive analytics. In addition to supporting the core grammar of graphics, DxR provides a grammar of immersive interactions. DxR builds around Microsoftâ€™s mixed reality ecosystem, mainly supporting HoloLens and IHMD (immersive head-mounted device) application development.

# Examples

From a few lines of declarative JSON specification (left), DxR generates an interactive visualization in Unity (right) that can be used in AR/VR applications.

DxR makes it easy to add custom marks and channels to enable engaging visualization designs. In this example, a 3D paper plane is used as mark to visualize air flow.
