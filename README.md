## Quick Guide

1. Install Unity3D editor [version 2017.2.0p1-MRTP4](http://beta.unity3d.com/download/b1565bfe4a0c/UnityDownloadAssistant.exe).
2. Import [DxR.unitypackage]() [TODO] into your project.
3. Open DxRExamples/template.unity.
4. Press play - you should see a simple DxR data visualization in your scene. If you connected and setup your HoloLens or Immersive Head-Mounted-Display (IHMD) for debugging, you should be able to view the visualization in an immersive environment. Detailed setup instructions can be found [here](SETUP.md).
5. To customize the visualization, edit StreamingAssets/DxRSpecs/template.json. Detailed instructions can be found [here](AUTHORING.md).
